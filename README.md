#android5000

android5000 is a lightweight library meant to provide a simple way to
 - organize game logic
 - load and unload scenes
 - unify draw calls
 
I consider the functionality implemented in android5000 the minimal to develop your average 3D game. The classes included handle
 - cameras
 - scenes (and the objects in them)
 - quaternions
 - meshes
 - custom shaders
 
This library is very much a work in progress and has so far been used (by myself) for prototyping shaders and for visualizing algorithms than manipulate 3D data.

This repository currently includes the library and an example activity that implements it to draw Suzanne.
